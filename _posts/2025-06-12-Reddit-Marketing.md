title: How SEO Led Me to Reddit Automation
published: false

It's no secret anymore, atleast in B2B SaaS marketing, that Google loves Reddit. As a marketer, that means SEO doesn't end at blog posts for me. I have to be where the users are. So I learned how to get really, really good at Reddit marketing. 

The story starts with leaving comments. Reddit comments, when done right, can be a powerful marketing channel. Often, especially in my domain, there were a lot of people asking for what we built on Reddit. There were people going from Google to Reddit looking for products like ours. So I had to come up with a systematic way of tracking Reddit. 

There are multiple problems to fix here:

1. Finding and commenting on all Reddit posts in the hope that some will get us traffic is tedious and inefficient. 
2. There's no easy way to track if we have commented on posts that are showing up on search. The marketing ecosystem around Reddit is quite nascent.
3. New conversations are happening all the time that are relevant to our business but we don't have a simple way of monitoring them.
