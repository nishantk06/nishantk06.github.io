Hello. 

Nice to meet you. Not a lot of people come to this area nowadays. It can get lonely, so it's good to have someone to talk to. 

My story begins in Sunil Appliances. I sat on the shelf to the right, and I have to be honest, it was a tough time in my life. Sunil was so desperate for someone to come and take me. He would show me to my customers, using words like ‘elegant’ and ‘decent’ or ‘simple’, but for months, they would ignore me and go for something else. He really tried hard with me, but they just didn’t like me. Day after day, they looked at me and turned their heads, and I told myself that it wasn’t me, that I can’t let other people’s choices impact me so much, that competition was tough these days, but at some point I started to feel dejected. Was there something wrong with me? That must be it. Nobody wanted me. Sunil would look at me sometimes, and I could see that he was so disappointed in me. I felt like a wasted investment. I let him down. 

I just sat there, a sad, unwanted, unloved piece of metal, for days and days. And then one day, Mr. Mamtaney showed up. Sunil gave his same speech about me - decent, simple, elegant, and I was ready for him to move on, but somehow, he picked me up from the shelf! What a trip. Sunil had a big smile on his face. And in no time, I was being hung in Mr. Mamtaney’s house!

Things happened so fast that I really had no time to process these changes. I was thrilled, of course, but also terribly anxious. I thought Mr. Mamtaney had made a mistake by picking me, that I didn’t deserve to be bought at all. I didn’t have what it took to be a great fan, I knew that. The other customers also knew it, which is why they passed over me. And this man had somehow missed it, but I was scared he might discover it soon enough. I’m not the real thing. Sunil was so sad with me. If I don’t cover this up, Mr. Mamtaney would feel the same way. 

I was determined to hide my faultiness, and so I resolved to be the best I could be for Mr. Mamtaney. The first time he switched me on, I started rotating instantly. I could feel the wind in my blades, and I was managing to play with it well, I thought. Mr. Mamtaney seemed satisfied, and that was terribly relieving.

Since then, I got into the practice and it just became a routine thing, nothing more. I got myself together, and Mr. Mamtaney would switch me on, whether daytime or nighttime, I rotated with perfect discipline. There were no pauses, no change in speed, just round and round and round. 

I won’t lie, it did get monotonous after the initial excitement faded. To do the same thing over and over again, it's not really the most exciting. But I never bothered with those things. I took great pride in my work - I was committed, hardworking, and never complained for a second. I don’t really know how to explain it, but there is a deep pleasure to be experienced in being a perfect fan like that, in not showing any vulnerability, in being exactingly submissive. I was the best fan I could be. And there was, of course, the rhythm, the groove of starting up each time and moving in the exact same way. It was like I was high, really. 

You know, there’s a strange way in which even when you’re moving in perfect rhythm, you can feel like you’re terribly still. And after a year had passed, that feeling had concretely set in. I felt like this is all I was doing, round and round and round, and sometimes I wanted to do was stop. To not have to run at his command. I dismissed that as stupid talk, though. This is the real world, I thought. There’s a way of doing things. Fans are obedient, uncomplaining servers, and I must follow suit. 

I kept thinking about stopping, though. It made me scared and really anxious too, I won’t lie. All this while, I’d been so perfect, not worrying Mr. and Mrs. Mamtaney once in all these years. I had attracted no attention, no controversy, had just quietly done my job. And if I stopped now, it would just prove that I really was faulty, that Mr. Mamtaney should have never picked me up in the first place. Even having such thoughts is a sign. I need to stop. Quiet. Focus on the rotating. Just the rotating. If thoughts arise, let them pass, and just rotate. 

Then one day it happened - my worst fears came true. Mr. Mamtaney switched me on, and I rushed to start the motor, but it just … wouldn’t. It was so embarrassing. Mr. Mamtaney looked at me and I could see that he was slightly annoyed, and I kept trying to just start, but my body would just refuse. That was a real freak-out. I tried everything, but somehow my body was just refusing. It has happened, I thought. The real me is out in the open. I tried to hide it for so many years but finally, I’ve proven that I’m just a faulty piece of metal. Mr. Mamtaney called the electrician the next day, and fixed the mistake he had made years ago. I was in the dumpyard. 

I will say one thing about the dumpyard - it really gives a fan time to think. I took years to get over my wrecked self-confidence since the Mr. Mamtaney incident, but eventually I realized that it was okay for me to have stopped, that even my rusted, non-functional interior is a part of me that deserves love. All this time, I tried to be the perfect fan because I thought that’s who I was meant to be. But now I’m here, and I realize I don’t have to be a fan anymore. I can just be me, and that’s okay. 

So that’s me. And the thing that’s funny, you know, is that you keep rotating your whole life to prove that you’re enough, and for what? To finally find yourself rusted and deeply inadequate, and then you realise that you gotta ditch the scales altogether. And now people come here to look for things they can pick up and I just go like no thank you, sir. I’m just fine here, just fine.
