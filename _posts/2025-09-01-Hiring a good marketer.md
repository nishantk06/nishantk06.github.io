Hiring in marketing has been one of my biggest pain points at Amuse Labs. We're not looking for a person who "has 5+ years of experience in digital marketing". We're looking for someone who has writing chops, can analyze performance data, optimize SEO and even enrich data and run outreach using Clay or Apollo if needed. By the way, this person also needs to have native-level English communication skills. 

I had thought finding someone like this would be somewhat easy. It is not at all. The problem I ran into again and again is that a person is either creativeTM, which means that they mention coffee somewhere on their resume or LinkedIn. Or they're GrowthHackerTM, which means they're really good with the tools but are not as creative and polished in their communication. 

I believe a great marketer is able to do both. What I find though is that people often end up categorizing themselves as either the creative type or the hacker type. They put themselves in these buckets voluntarily. A creative gets initimidated if you talk about data analysis or technical SEO too much. A hacker-type is not very enthusiastic about copywriting or writing cold emails.

At least in B2B SaaS marketing at a 30-person startup, there is no place for someone who cannot do both. The friction introduced by having a markops/gtm person and another content and copy person is simply not affordable if you'd like to move fast. ONE person has to have the vision of the experience they would like prospects to have, and that person needs to know how to provide that experience. That is simply it.

## Why would they want us?
