Welcome to my blog! I'm Nishant Kauntia. I currently lead marketing at Amuse Labs, a B2B SaaS company. I'm learning and growing in the field, and hope to share some of that here. 

I graduated with a degree in Philosophy and Media Studies from Ashoka University, where I was also a teaching fellow. In a previous life, I used to work as a freelance journalist for The Caravan, Scroll and other media houses.
